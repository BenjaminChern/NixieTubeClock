# Nixie Tube Clock
An overview of the process I took to make a nixie tube clock 

# Inspiration
Around the winter of 2021, I was looking for a new arduino project to work on over the holidays when I stumbled across a reddit post leading to [IllyaMoskvin's nixie tube display](https://github.com/IllyaMoskvin/nixie-counter). Inspired by that, I looked at tons of nixie tube clocks online to find inspiration. I finally settled upon [Neonix's clock](https://www.etsy.com/listing/931590165/nixie-tube-clock-neonix-412-customizable?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=nixie+tube+clock&ref=sc_gallery-1-5&plkey=ac1318e828d258e6cba0e64b21e83669887453da%3A931590165&frs=1&sts=1), as it looked the most polished out of any clock I had seen so far.
In an ideal world, the clock has an alarm function with custom music, 3 buttons, one snooze, and two to toggle time, and a web app to set an auto-turn-off time to preserve the life of the nixies

# Planning 
In my mind, this project was split into 3 parts. Metalworking, Woodworking and Electronics. The electronics part of the project would be the easiest, as I have the most experience in this area. I bought 4 [exixe driver boards](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/exixe-miniture-nixie-tube-driver-modules/#product-reviews) for $13 each, 4 [in12-b nixie tubes](https://www.ebay.com/itm/131964707917?hash=item1eb9b5a44d:g:C3cAAOSwmLlX-i1o) for $4 each, and
