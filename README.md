# Nixie Tube Clock

This document is intended to explain the technical details of my nixie tube clock, while also providing a rough overview of the journey I took to make this product a reality. Do note that this is my first fully completed project, and the first product I have made that has aesthetics as a main priority. As such, take my process as a loose guideline instead of a set of instructions. Hopefully this write-up will help people avoid some of the mistakes I made during this project, and give people a look into the evolution of ideas during its creation.

# Inspiration
During the winter of 2021, I was looking for a new arduino project to work on over the holidays when I stumbled across a reddit post leading to [IllyaMoskvin's nixie tube display](https://github.com/IllyaMoskvin/nixie-counter). I had already seen a video about the subject 3 months ago by the youtube channel [GreatScott!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObgmVNV1Kfg) and these two events led me to create my nixie tube clock. Big thanks to IllyaMoskvin in particular for their great write-up detailing their work. I looked at tons of nixie tube clocks online to find inspiration for the aesthetics of the build, and I finally settled upon [Neonix's clock](https://www.neonix.one/en#buy) as the product I wanted to emulate. The curved corners complemented the rounded edges of the tubes and I especailly liked the slight inset of the wooden faceplate in the aluminum body. Neonix's clock also contained many useful features that I wanted to include as well. In my ideal world, the clock would have an alarm function with custom music, 3 buttons (one snooze, and two to toggle time), and a web app to set an auto-turn-off time to preserve the life of the nixies. Looking back, that was very ambitious, and almost everything I had planned was eventually scrapped due to space, time and cost constraints. 

# Planning 
In my mind, this project was split into 3 parts. Metalworking, Woodworking and Electronics. The electronics part of the project would be the most comfortable for me, as I have the most experience in this area. Nixie tubes require around 170V DC to run, meaning that I need to purchase a boost converter to step up the 12V from a DC barrel jack to 170V. Additionally, each Nixie tube has 10 pins,  I bought 4 [exixe driver boards](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/exixe-miniture-nixie-tube-driver-modules/#product-reviews) for $13 each, 4 [in12-b nixie tubes](https://www.ebay.com/itm/131964707917?hash=item1eb9b5a44d:g:C3cAAOSwmLlX-i1o) for $4 each, and the rest of the products, I already had leftover from other products.
