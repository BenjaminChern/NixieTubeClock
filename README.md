# Nixie Tube Clock

This document is intended to explain the technical details of my nixie tube clock, while also providing a rough overview of the journey I took to make this product a reality. Hopefully this write-up will help people avoid some of the mistakes I made during this project, and give people a look into the ideas I had to cut over time order to make this.

# Inspiration
During the winter of 2021, I was looking for a new arduino project to work on over the holidays when I stumbled across a reddit post leading to [IllyaMoskvin's nixie tube display](https://github.com/IllyaMoskvin/nixie-counter). I had already seen a video about the subject 3 months ago by the youtube channel [GreatScott!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObgmVNV1Kfg) and because of these two events, I decided to venture deeper into the subject of nixie tubes. I looked at tons of nixie tube clocks online to find inspiration and I finally settled upon [Neonix's clock](https://www.etsy.com/listing/931590165/nixie-tube-clock-neonix-412-customizable?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=nixie+tube+clock&ref=sc_gallery-1-5&plkey=ac1318e828d258e6cba0e64b21e83669887453da%3A931590165&frs=1&sts=1) as the product I wanted to emulate because it looked the most polished out of any clock I had seen so far. In my ideal world, the clock had an alarm function with custom music, 3 buttons, one snooze, and two to toggle time, and a web app to set an auto-turn-off time to preserve the life of the nixies. However, almost everything I had planned was eventually scrapped due to space, time and cost constraints. 

# Planning 
In my mind, this project was split into 3 parts. Metalworking, Woodworking and Electronics. The electronics part of the project would be the most comfortable for me, as I have the most experience in this area. I bought 4 [exixe driver boards](https://www.tindie.com/products/dekuNukem/exixe-miniture-nixie-tube-driver-modules/#product-reviews) for $13 each, 4 [in12-b nixie tubes](https://www.ebay.com/itm/131964707917?hash=item1eb9b5a44d:g:C3cAAOSwmLlX-i1o) for $4 each, and the rest of the products, I already had leftover from other products. (The full parts list and price can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13VwZzKPhzOkpslhoitIj5g3k4Q4i2Dl7qZcKzXsNUyM/edit?usp=sharing))
