# NixieTubeClock
An overview of the process I took to make a nixie tube clock 

# Inspiration
Around the winter of 2021, I was looking for a new arduino project to work on over the holidays when I stumbled across a reddit post leading to IllyaMoskvin's nixie tube display. Inspired by that, I looked at tons of nixie tube clocks online to find inspiration. I finally settled upon Neonix's clock, as it looked the most polished out of any clock I had seen so far.
